# MARSROVERS
MARS Rovers challenge

Project developed for AmDocs selection process.

The test was implemented using a Singleton for the Plateau, since it will aways be just one.
A class for the Rover object was created, so each rover deployed in the plateau will be an distinc instance.
The Main class reads the Plateau information and the Rovers state and movements. Then, the movements are processed and the final state for each rover is printed.
To run the program, compile the code (Java 11) and run the "Main" class. Each input line can be entered through keyboard input, or through a text file by running the application via command line with " < inputFile.txt" option.
